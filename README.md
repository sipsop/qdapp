# Positioning

## flexDirection

Element size depends on the ``flex`` property (e.g. if all elements have ``flex: 1``,
then they all have equal size).

* ``row``
* ``column``

This specifies whether the primary axis is 'rows' or 'columns'.

## justifyContent

Specify how to layout things along the primary axis.

* ``flex-start``: left aligned (no spacing)
* ``flex-end``: right aligned (no spacing)
* ``center``: center the items (no spacing)
* ``space-between``: spread the items across the height/width, align them on the left
* ``space-around``: spread the items across the height/width, align them in the center

## alignItems

Specify how to layout the elements along the secondary axis.

* ``flex-start``
* ``center``
* ``flex-end``
* ``stretch``
